# Memory Game Project

So this game was a project provided through Udacity for me to complete!  It was dificult, but 
the most rewarding things often are! 

## HOW TO PLAY

* Clicking on a card will start the timer
* Click the black squares(cards) to reveal the card
* Match all 8 pairs of cards!
* To win find all 8 matches!
* Play as many times as you like by pressing the restart icon!

## Game Functionality

* What can you expect this game to do?
    * It records the time from start to finsih
    * It counts the total moves you made until completion!
    * It will even congratulate you when you complete the game!

## Try it yourself!

## API/BOOTSTRAP
Right now I am using Coda Font in my code.  I have a linked style sheet in the head.
Bootstrap is being used both for the font, and to set up a small grid for the score-panel.
